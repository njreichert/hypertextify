# Markdown Sample file.

## An introduction.

Markdown is a markup language designed by John Gruber. In his words: 

> Markdown is intended to be as easy-to-read and easy-to-write as is feasible.

Links are given with square brackets and parentheses. For example, the above quote is given by this [link](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax). Other basic things include _using underscores for emphasis,_ **sets of asterisks for bold (strong) text.**  
Moving text to a new line requires one to put two spaces at the end of the previous line. 

Moving text to a new paragraph is done with two newlines.

    Code Blocks are initiated with a tab or 4 spaces.
    all indentation and newlines are interpreted literally.

1. ordered lists are started with a number followed by a period.

2. having a new line makes all ordered list items `<p>` tags.

* An unordered list looks like this.


- or this.
  


+ or this.
    All spacing is ignored on newlines unless another newline precedes it.

markdown ignores lots of spacing like the above.
